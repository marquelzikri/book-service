Called \\\"Bertie\\\" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former domestic servant). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team. Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.\\nA defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he started reading books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.\\nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the Southsea Drapery Emporium, Hyde's. His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices, later inspired his novels The Wheels of Chance and Kipps, which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.\\nWells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a Protestant and his father a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. Fortunately for Herbert, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato's Republic, and More's Utopia. This would be the beginning of Herbert George Wells's venture into literature. In 1891, Wells married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells. The couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he fell in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (later known as Jane), with whom he moved to Woking, Surrey in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, 'Lynton', (now No.141) Maybury Road in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895. His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career, for while there he planned and wrote The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, completed The Island of Dr Moreau, wrote and published The Wonderful Visit and The Wheels of Chance, and began writing two other early books, When The Sleeper Wakes and Love and Mr Lewisham.\\nIn late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in Worcester Park, near Kingston upon Thames for two years until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where in 1901 he constructed a large family home: Spade House. He had two sons with Jane: George Philip (known as \\\"Gip\\\") in 1901 (died 1985) and Frank Richard in 1903 (died 1982).\\nWith his wife Jane's consent, Wells had affairs with a number of women, including the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger, adventurer and writer Odette Keun, Soviet spy Moura Budberg and novelist Elizabeth von Arnim. In 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society; and in 1914, a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells' \\\"sordid intrigue\\\" with the daughter of veteran Fabian Sidney Olivier, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. In Experiment in Autobiography (1934), Wells wrote: \\\"I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply\\\". David Lodge's novel A Man of Parts (2011) – a 'narrative based on factual sources' (author's note) – gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells's relations with the women mentioned above, and others.\",\n        \"name\": \"H.

G.\\\" Wells (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a \\\"father of science fiction\\\", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.\\nWells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist. Novels like Kipps and The History of Mr Polly, which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. A diabetic, in 1934, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as Diabetes UK).\",\n        \"born\": \"1866-09-20T16:52:48.000Z\",\n        \"died\": \"1946-08-12T16:30:00.000Z\",\n        \"wikipediaId\": 1,\n        \"books\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 1,\n                \"contentName\": \"35.txt.utf-8\",\n                \"isbn\": \"0451528557\",\n                \"originalTitle\": \"The Time Machine\",\n                \"year\": 1895,\n                \"authorName\": \"H.

The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.\\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.\\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.\\nMeanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.\\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.\\nOverwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey. After promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.\",\n                \"genres\": [],\n                \"copyright\": \"Copyrighted.

G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative. Wells is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \\\"time machine\\\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.\\nThe Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.\",\n                \"contentCleaned\": true,\n                \"classes\": [\n                    \"to-read\",\n                    \"currently-reading\",\n                    \"classics\",\n                    \"science-fiction\",\n                    \"sci-fi\",\n                    \"fiction\",\n                    \"classic\",\n                    \"favorites\",\n                    \"time-travel\",\n                    \"fantasy\",\n                    \"owned\",\n                    \"scifi\",\n                    \"books-i-own\",\n                    \"kindle\",\n                    \"dystopia\",\n                    \"sci-fi-fantasy\",\n                    \"literature\",\n                    \"adventure\",\n                    \"dystopian\",\n                    \"steampunk\",\n                    \"sf\",\n                    \"1001-books\",\n                    \"novels\",\n                    \"ebook\",\n                    \"19th-century\",\n                    \"ebooks\",\n                    \"owned-books\",\n                    \"audiobook\",\n                    \"1001\",\n                    \"british\",\n                    \"classic-literature\",\n                    \"scifi-fantasy\",\n                    \"to-buy\",\n                    \"audiobooks\",\n                    \"english\",\n                    \"library\",\n                    \"my-ebooks\",\n                    \"fantasy-sci-fi\",\n                    \"school\",\n                    \"classics-to-read\",\n                    \"default\",\n                    \"adult\",\n                    \"science-fiction-fantasy\",\n                    \"h-g-wells\",\n                    \"1001-books-to-read-before-you-die\",\n                    \"speculative-fiction\",\n                    \"e-books\",\n                    \"novel\",\n                    \"science\",\n                    \"classic-fiction\",\n                    \"favourites\",\n                    \"my-library\",\n                    \"british-literature\",\n                    \"e-book\",\n                    \"my-books\",\n                    \"victorian\",\n                    \"audio\",\n                    \"adult-fiction\",\n                    \"book-club\",\n                    \"books\",\n                    \"read-for-school\",\n                    \"classic-lit\",\n                    \"sci-fi-and-fantasy\",\n                    \"read-in-2015\",\n                    \"to-read-classics\",\n                    \"i-own\",\n                    \"nook\",\n                    \"read-in-2014\",\n                    \"read-in-2016\",\n                    \"english-literature\",\n                    \"novella\",\n                    \"fantasy-scifi\",\n                    \"audio-books\",\n                    \"wish-list\",\n                    \"1800s\",\n                    \"england\",\n                    \"kindle-books\",\n                    \"own-it\",\n                    \"classic-sci-fi\",\n                    \"1001-books-you-must-read-before-you\",\n                    \"historical\",\n                    \"read-in-2013\",\n                    \"read-in-english\",\n                    \"horror\",\n                    \"young-adult\",\n                    \"ciencia-ficciï¿½n\",\n                    \"read-in-2017\",\n                    \"sf-masterworks\",\n                    \"british-lit\",\n                    \"audible\",\n                    \"historical-fiction\",\n                    \"owlcrate\",\n                    \"uk\",\n                    \"audio-book\",\n                    \"post-apocalyptic\",\n                    \"re-read\",\n                    \"future\",\n                    \"sf-fantasy\",\n                    \"travel\",\n                    \"time\"\n                ],\n                \"contentAvailable\": false,\n                \"nAuthors\": 1,\n                \"wikipediaId\": null,\n                \"goodreadsId\": null,\n                \"gutenbergId\": null\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"contentName\": \"36.txt.utf-8\",\n                \"isbn\": \"0375759239\",\n                \"originalTitle\": \"The War of the Worlds\",\n                \"year\": 1898,\n                \"authorName\": \"H.

Wells’ other novels, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines – the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine – they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.\",\n                \"locClass\": \"PR: Language and Literatures: English literature\",\n                \"pages\": 192,\n                \"language\": \"English\",\n                \"isbn13\": \"9780375759239\",\n                \"countries\": [\n                    1\n                ],\n                \"releaseDate\": \"2004-09-30T17:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"author\": 1,\n                \"cover\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320391644l/8909.jpg\",\n                \"summary\": \"The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells first serialised in 1897 in the UK by Pearson's Magazine and in the United States by Cosmopolitan magazine. The novel's first appearance in hardcover was in 1898 from publisher William Heinemann of London. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one of the earliest stories that detail a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race. The novel is the first-person narrative of both an unnamed protagonist in Surrey and of his younger brother in London as southern England is invaded by Martians. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science fiction canon.\\nThe plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears and prejudices. At the time of publication, it was classified as a scientific romance, like Wells' earlier novel The Time Machine. The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never been out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It has even influenced the work of scientists, notably Robert H. Goddard, who, inspired by the book, invented both the liquid fuelled rocket and multistage rocket, which resulted in the Apollo 11 Moon landing 71 years later.\",\n                \"contentCleaned\": true,\n                \"classes\": [\n                    \"to-read\",\n                    \"currently-reading\",\n                    \"classics\",\n                    \"science-fiction\",\n                    \"sci-fi\",\n                    \"fiction\",\n                    \"classic\",\n                    \"favorites\",\n                    \"owned\",\n                    \"scifi\",\n                    \"books-i-own\",\n                    \"fantasy\",\n                    \"kindle\",\n                    \"sci-fi-fantasy\",\n                    \"literature\",\n                    \"sf\",\n                    \"horror\",\n                    \"1001-books\",\n                    \"aliens\",\n                    \"default\",\n                    \"novels\",\n                    \"owned-books\",\n                    \"19th-century\",\n                    \"ebook\",\n                    \"ebooks\",\n                    \"1001\",\n                    \"audiobook\",\n                    \"war\",\n                    \"library\",\n                    \"british\",\n                    \"classic-literature\",\n                    \"fantasy-sci-fi\",\n                    \"to-buy\",\n                    \"h-g-wells\",\n                    \"audiobooks\",\n                    \"english\",\n                    \"my-library\",\n                    \"classics-to-read\",\n                    \"scifi-fantasy\",\n                    \"my-ebooks\",\n                    \"dystopian\",\n                    \"science-fiction-fantasy\",\n                    \"1001-books-to-read-before-you-die\",\n                    \"novel\",\n                    \"favourites\",\n                    \"books\",\n                    \"my-books\",\n                    \"british-literature\",\n                    \"e-book\",\n                    \"adventure\",\n                    \"adult\",\n                    \"dystopia\",\n                    \"school\",\n                    \"50-books-to-read-before-you-die\",\n                    \"science\",\n                    \"audio\",\n                    \"speculative-fiction\",\n                    \"i-own\",\n                    \"apocalyptic\",\n                    \"e-books\",\n                    \"sci-fi-and-fantasy\",\n                    \"alien-invasion\",\n                    \"nook\",\n                    \"wish-list\",\n                    \"classic-fiction\",\n                    \"classic-sci-fi\",\n                    \"to-read-classics\",\n                    \"audible\",\n                    \"england\",\n                    \"victorian\",\n                    \"sf-fantasy\",\n                    \"own-it\",\n                    \"english-literature\",\n                    \"adult-fiction\",\n                    \"kindle-books\",\n                    \"audio-books\",\n                    \"sf-masterworks\",\n                    \"1001-books-you-must-read-before-you\",\n                    \"thriller\",\n                    \"classic-lit\",\n                    \"post-apocalyptic\",\n                    \"unfinished\",\n                    \"science-fiction-and-fantasy\",\n                    \"abandoned\",\n                    \"1800s\",\n                    \"mars\",\n                    \"the-classics\",\n                    \"movies\",\n                    \"ciencia-ficciï¿½n\",\n                    \"own-to-read\",\n                    \"steampunk\",\n                    \"unread\",\n                    \"read-in-2013\",\n                    \"fantasy-scifi\",\n                    \"did-not-finish\",\n                    \"read-in-english\",\n                    \"read-in-2016\",\n                    \"home-library\",\n                    \"apocalypse\",\n                    \"book-club\"\n                ],\n                \"contentAvailable\": true,\n                \"nAuthors\": 1,\n                \"wikipediaId\": null,\n                \"goodreadsId\": null,\n                \"gutenbergId\": null\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\": 9,\n                \"contentName\": \"159.txt.utf-8\",\n                \"isbn\": \"0425120295\",\n                \"originalTitle\": \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\",\n                \"year\": 1896,\n                \"authorName\": \"H.

A passing ship takes him aboard, and a man named Montgomery revives him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M'ling, who appears to be Montgomery's manservant. The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery. As they approach the island, Montgomery's destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in a dinghy and sails away. Seeing that the captain has abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an enclosed compound.\\nThe island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome experiments in vivisection had been publicly exposed and has fled England as a result of his exposure.\\nThe next day, Moreau begins working on a puma. Prendick gathers that Moreau is performing a painful experiment on the animal, and its anguished cries drive Prendick out into the jungle. While he wanders, he comes upon a group of people who seem human but have an unmistakable resemblance to swine. As he walks back to the enclosure, he suddenly realises he is being followed by a figure in the jungle. He panics and flees, and the figure gives chase. As his pursuer bears down on him, Prendick manages to stun him with a stone and observes the pursuer is a monstrous hybrid of animal and man. When Prendrick returns to the enclosure and questions Montgomery, Montgomery refuses to be open with him. After failing to get an explanation, Prendick finally gives in and takes a sleeping draught.\\nPrendick awakes the next morning with the previous night's activities fresh in his mind. Seeing that the door to Moreau's operating room has been left unlocked, he walks in to find a humanoid form lying in bandages on the table before he is ejected by a shocked and angry Moreau. He believes that Moreau has been vivisecting humans and that he is the next test subject. He flees into the jungle where he meets an Ape-Man who takes him to a colony of similarly half-human/half-animal creatures. Their leader is a large grey thing named the Sayer of the Law who has him recite a strange litany called the Law that involves prohibitions against bestial behavior and praise for Moreau.\\nSuddenly, Dr. Moreau bursts into the colony looking for Prendick, but Prendick escapes to the jungle. He makes for the ocean, where he plans to drown himself rather than allow Moreau to experiment on him. Moreau explains that the creatures called the Beast Folk were not formerly men, but rather animals. Prendick returns to the enclosure, where Moreau explains that he has been on the island for eleven years and has been striving to make a complete transformation of an animal to a human. He explains that while he is getting closer to perfection, his subjects have a habit of reverting to their animal form and behaviour. Moreau regards the pain he inflicts as insignificant and an unavoidable side effect in the name of his scientific experiments.\\nOne day, Prendick and Montgomery encounter a half-eaten rabbit. Since eating flesh and tasting blood are strong prohibitions, Dr. Moreau calls an assembly of the Beast Folk and identifies the Leopard-Man (the same one that chased Prendick the first time he wandered into the jungle) as the transgressor. Knowing that he will be sent back to Dr. Moreau's compound for more painful sessions of vivisection, the Leopard-Man flees. Eventually, the group corners him in some undergrowth, but Prendick takes pity and shoots him to spare him from further suffering. Prendick also believes that although the Leopard-Man was seen breaking several laws, such as drinking water bent down like an animal, chasing men (Prendick), and running on all fours, the Leopard-Man was not solely responsible for the deaths of the rabbits. It was also the Hyena-Swine, the next most dangerous Beast Man on the island. Dr. Moreau is furious that Prendick killed the Leopard-Man but can do nothing about the situation.\\nAs time passes, Prendick becomes inured to the grotesqueness of the Beast Folk. However one day, the half-finished puma woman rips free of her restraints and escapes from the lab. Dr. Moreau pursues her, but the two end up fighting each other which ends in a mutual kill. Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island, but later hears a commotion outside in which Montgomery, his servant M'ling, and the Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk. At the same time, the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp. With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure, Prendick realizes that during the night Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island.\\nPrendick lives with the Beast Folk on the island for months after the deaths of Moreau and Montgomery. As the time goes by, the Beast Folk increasingly revert to their original animal instincts, beginning to hunt the island's rabbits, returning to walking on all fours, and leaving their shared living areas for the wild. They cease to follow Prendick's instructions and eventually the Hyena-Swine kills his faithful companion, a Dog-Man created from a St. Bernard. Prendick then shoots the Hyena-Swine in self-defence with the help of the Sloth Creature. Luckily for Prendick ever since his efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful, a boat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (perhaps the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor). Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days later. But when he tells his story he is thought to be mad, so he feigns amnesia.\\nBack in England, Prendick is no longer comfortable in the presence of humans who seem to him to be about to revert to the animal state. He leaves London and lives in near-solitude in the countryside, devoting himself to chemistry as well as astronomy in the studies of which he finds some peace.\",\n                \"genres\": [],\n                \"copyright\": \"Public domain in the USA.\",\n                \"title\": \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\",\n                \"averageRating\": null,\n                \"ratingCount\": null,\n                \"similarBooks\": [\n                    \"Spacecraft: 2000-2100 AD\",\n                    \"The early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying\",\n                    \"Anak Mat Lela Gila\",\n                    \"Sitora Harimau Jadian\",\n                    \"The Stone God Awakens\",\n                    \"The Essential Writings of Machiavelli\",\n                    \"Yang Nakal-Nakal\",\n                    \"The Lottery Ticket\",\n                    \"One Lonely Night\",\n                    \"Moby Dick\",\n                    \"The Game\",\n                    \"The Star Wars (The Star Wars, #2)\",\n                    \"Kembara Sastera Nisah Haron : United Kingdom & Dublin\",\n                    \"Animal Farm and Related Readings\",\n                    \"Anak Bajang Menggiring Angin\",\n                    \"The Definitive H.P.

The novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. Wells described the novel as \\\"an exercise in youthful blasphemy\\\".\\nThe Island of Doctor Moreau is a classic of early science fiction and remains one of Wells's best-known books.

G. Wells. The book is based on a prediction of nuclear weapons of a more destructive and uncontrollable sort than the world has yet seen. It had appeared first in serialised form with a different ending as A Prophetic Trilogy, consisting of three books: A Trap to Catch the Sun, The Last War in the World and The World Set Free.\\nA frequent theme of Wells's work, as in his 1901 nonfiction book Anticipations, was the history of humans' mastery of power and energy through technological advance, seen as a determinant of human progress. The novel begins: \\\"The history of mankind is the history of the attainment of external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making animal. . . . Always down a lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and again, he is doing more.\\\" (Many of the ideas Wells develops here found a fuller development when he wrote The Outline of History in 1918-1919.) The novel is dedicated \\\"To Frederick Soddy's Interpretation of Radium,\\\" a volume published in 1909.\\nScientists of the time were well aware that the slow natural radioactive decay of elements like radium continues for thousands of years, and that while the rate of energy release is negligible, the total amount released is huge. Wells used this as the basis for his story. In his fiction,\\n\\nThe problem which was already being mooted by such scientific men as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, in the very beginning of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933.\\n\\nWells's knowledge of atomic physics came from reading William Ramsay, Ernest Rutherford, and Frederick Soddy; the last discovered the disintegration of uranium. Soddy's book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt praises The World Set Free. Wells's novel may even have influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leï¿½ Szilï¿½rd read the book in 1932, the same year the neutron was discovered. In 1933 Szilï¿½rd conceived the idea of neutron chain reaction, and filed for patents on it in 1934.\\nWells's \\\"atomic bombs\\\" have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a \\\"bomb-thrower\\\" biting off \\\"a little celluloid stud.\\\" They consist of \\\"lumps of pure Carolinum\\\" that induce \\\"a blazing continual explosion\\\" whose half-life is seventeen days, so that it is \\\"never entirely exhausted,\\\" so that \\\"to this day the battle-fields and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.\\\"\\n\\nNever before in the history of warfare had there been a continuing explosive; indeed, up to the middle of the twentieth century the only explosives known were combustibles whose explosiveness was due entirely to their instantaneousness; and these atomic bombs which science burst upon the world that night were strange even to the men who used them.\\n\\nWells observes:\\n\\nCertainly it seems now that nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands [...] All through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of energy that men were able to command was continually increasing. Applied to warfare that meant that the power to inflict a blow, the power to destroy, was continually increasing [...]There was no increase whatever in the ability to escape [...]Destruction was becoming so facile that any little body of malcontents could use it [...]Before the last war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city.\\n\\nWells viewed war as the inevitable result of the Modern State; the introduction of atomic energy in a world divided resulted in the collapse of society. The only possibilities remaining were \\\"either the relapse of mankind to agricultural barbarism from which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the basis of a new social order.\\\" Wells's theme of world government is presented as a solution to the threat of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nFrom the first they had to see the round globe as one problem; it was impossible any longer to deal with it piece by piece. They had to secure it universally from any fresh outbreak of atomic destruction, and they had to ensure a permanent and universal pacification.\\n\\nThe devastation of the war leads the French ambassador at Washington, Leblanc, to summon world leaders to a conference at Brissago, where Britain's \\\"King Egbert\\\" sets an example by abdicating in favor of a world state. Such is the state of the world's exhaustion that the effective coup of this \\\"council\\\" (\\\"Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government. It was of an extravagant illegality.\\\") is resisted only in a few places. The defeat of Serbia's \\\"King Ferdinand Charles\\\" and his attempt to destroy the council and seize control of the world is narrated in some detail.\\nBrought to its senses, humanity creates a utopian order along Wellsian lines in short order. Atomic energy has solved the problem of work. In the new order \\\"the majority of our population consists of artists.\\\"\\nThe World Set Free concludes with a chapter recounting the reflections of one of the new order's sages, Marcus Karenin, during his last days.

Bedford rents a small countryside house in Lympne, in Kent, where he wants to work in peace. He is bothered every afternoon, however, at precisely the same time, by a passer-by making odd noises. After two weeks Bedford accosts the man, who proves to be a reclusive physicist named Mr. Cavor. Bedford befriends Cavor when he learns he is developing a new material, cavorite, which can negate the force of gravity.\\nWhen a sheet of cavorite is prematurely processed, it makes the air above it weightless and shoots off into space. Bedford sees in the commercial production of cavorite a possible source of \\\"wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied; we might own and order the whole world\\\". Cavor hits upon the idea of a spherical spaceship made of \\\"steel, lined with glass\\\", and with sliding \\\"windows or blinds\\\" made of cavorite by which it can be steered, and persuades a reluctant Bedford to undertake a voyage to the moon; Cavor is certain there is no life there.\\nOn the way to the moon, they experience weightlessness, which Bedford finds \\\"exceedingly restful\\\". On the surface of the moon the two men discover a desolate landscape, but as the sun rises, the thin, frozen atmosphere vaporizes and strange plants begin to grow with extraordinary rapidity. Bedford and Cavor leave the capsule, but in romping about get lost in the rapidly growing jungle. They hear for the first time a mysterious booming coming from beneath their feet. They encounter \\\"great beasts\\\", \\\"monsters of mere fatness\\\", that they dub \\\"mooncalves\\\", and five-foot-high \\\"Selenites\\\" tending them. At first they hide and crawl about, but growing hungry partake of some \\\"monstrous coralline growths\\\" of fungus that inebriate them. They wander drunkenly until they encounter a party of six extraterrestrials, who capture them. The insectoid lunar natives (referred to as \\\"Selenites\\\", after Selene, the moon goddess) are part of a complex and technologically sophisticated society that lives underground, but this is revealed only in radio communications received from Cavor after Bedford's return to earth.\\nBedford and Cavor break out of captivity beneath the surface of the moon and flee, killing several Selenites. In their flight they discover that gold is common on the moon. In their attempt to find their way back to the surface and to their sphere, they come upon some Selenites carving up mooncalves but fight their way past. Back on the surface, they split up to search for their spaceship. Bedford finds it but returns to Earth without Cavor, who injured himself in a fall and was recaptured by the Selenites, as Bedford learns from a hastily scribbled note he left behind.\\nChapter 19, \\\"Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space\\\", plays no role in the plot but is a remarkable set piece in which the narrator describes experiencing a quasi-mystical \\\"pervading doubt of my own identity. . . the doubts within me could still argue: 'It is not you that is reading, it is Bedford—but you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the mistake comes in.' 'Counfound it!' I cried, 'and if I am not Bedford, what am I? But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions like shadow seem from far away... Do you know I had an idea that really I was something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole through which I looked at life...\\\"\\nBy good fortune, the narrator lands in the sea off the coast of Britain, near the seaside town of Littlestone, not far from his point of departure. His fortune is made by some gold he brings back, but he loses the sphere when a curious boy named Tommy Simmons climbs into the unattended sphere and shoots off into space. Bedford writes and publishes his story in The Strand Magazine, then learns that \\\"Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America\\\", has picked up fragments of radio communications from Cavor sent from inside the moon. During a period of relative freedom Cavor has taught two Selenites English and learned much about lunar society.\\nCavor's account explains that Selenites exist in thousands of forms and find fulfillment in carrying out the specific social function for which they have been brought up: specialization is the essence of Selenite society. \\\"With knowledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about them and remained brutes—equipped,\\\" remarks the Grand Lunar, when he finally meets Cavor and hears about life on Earth. Unfortunately, Cavor reveals humanity's propensity for war; the lunar leader and those listening to the interview are \\\"stricken with amazement\\\". Bedford infers that it is for this reason that Cavor has been prevented from further broadcasting to Earth. Cavor's transmissions are cut off as he is trying to describe how to make cavorite. His final fate is unknown, but Bedford is sure that \\\"we shall never… receive another message from the moon\\\".\",\n                \"genres\": [],\n                \"copyright\": \"Public domain in the USA.\",\n                \"title\": \"The First Men in the Moon\",\n                \"averageRating\": null,\n                \"ratingCount\": null,\n                \"similarBooks\": [\n                    \"Dark Benediction\",\n                    \"The Complete Roderick\",\n                    \"Helliconia Trilogy\",\n                    \"Life During Wartime\",\n                    \"Downward to the Earth\",\n                    \"The Child Garden\",\n                    \"The Centauri Device\",\n                    \"Sirius: A Fantasy of Love and Discord\",\n                    \"Emphyrio\",\n                    \"R.U.R. & War with the Newts\",\n                    \"The Land That Time Forgot (Caspak, #1-3)\",\n                    \"Jem\",\n                    \"From the Earth to the Moon (Extraordinary Voyages, #4)\",\n                    \"Cities in Flight (Cities in Flight, #1-4)\",\n                    \"The Dancers at the End of Time (Dancers at the End of Time, #1-3)\",\n                    \"Pavane\",\n                    \"Now Wait for Last Year\",\n                    \"Floating Worlds\"\n                ],\n                \"description\": \"When penniless businessman Mr Bedford retreats to the Kent coast to write a play, he meets by chance the brilliant Dr Cavor, an absent-minded scientist on the brink of developing a material that blocks gravity.

The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads that the \\\"Sleeper\\\" has awakened. A mob gathers around the building and demands to see the fabled Sleeper. The people around Graham will not answer his questions. They place Graham under house arrest. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world.\\nRebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape. They say that the people need Graham's leadership to rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them. Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers have gathered to prepare for the revolution. They march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police. In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries. He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a plutocracy and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a figurehead. The old man thinks that the Sleeper is a made-up figure used to brainwash the population.\\nGraham meets Ostrog, who says that the rebels have won and that the people are demanding that the Sleeper should rule. Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry; and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life ends when Helen tells him that for the lower class the revolution has changed nothing. Graham questions Ostrog who admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited but defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so.\\nOstrog admits that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council. Ostrog has used a black African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself.\\nGraham visits London in disguise to see how the workers live. Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers toil in factories, paid in food for each days work, with no job security. They speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife. Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade. The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by \\\"babble machines\\\" which spread news and \\\"pleasure cities\\\" where unspecified joys are available. \\\"Euthanasy\\\" is considered normal.\\nGraham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London. Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London.\\nOstrog escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London. His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks Ostrog's aeroplane but fails. Graham's aeroplane crashes.\",\n                \"genres\": [],\n                \"copyright\": \"Public domain in the USA.\",\n                \"title\": \"When the Sleeper Wakes\",\n                \"averageRating\": null,\n                \"ratingCount\": null,\n                \"similarBooks\": [\n                    \"The Coming Race\",\n                    \"Caesar's Column: A Story of the Twentieth Century\",\n                    \"The Iron Heel\",\n                    \"A Strange Manuscript found in a Copper Cylinder\",\n                    \"Off On A Comet\",\n                    \"The Mortal Immortal: The Complete Supernatural Short Fiction of Mary Shelley\",\n                    \"Ayesha: The Return of She\",\n                    \"The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis\",\n                    \"The Complete Moon Trilogy: The Moon Maid/The Moon Men/The Red Hawk\",\n                    \"The Fortunes of Captain Blood\",\n                    \"The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters, Volume Two (Miss Temple, Doctor Svenson, and Cardinal Chang #1.2)\",\n                    \"The Lost World & Other Stories\",\n                    \"One\",\n                    \"Georgia on My Mind and Other Places\",\n                    \"A Prisoner in Fairyland\",\n                    \"House of Corruption\",\n                    \"The Blazing World and Other Writings\",\n                    \"Erewhon (Erewhon , #1)\"\n                ],\n                \"description\": \"Graham, an 1890s radical pamphleteer who is eagerly awaiting the twentieth century and all the advances it will bring, is stricken with insomnia.

He wakes up in 2100. He later learns that he has inherited huge wealth and that his money has been put into a trust. Over the years, the trustees, the \\\"White Council\\\", have used his wealth to establish a vast political and economic world order.\\nWhen he wakes Graham is disoriented. The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads that the \\\"Sleeper\\\" has awakened. A mob gathers around the building and demands to see the fabled Sleeper. The people around Graham will not answer his questions. They place Graham under house arrest. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world.\\nRebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape. They say that the people need Graham's leadership to rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them. Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers have gathered to prepare for the revolution. They march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police. In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries. He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a plutocracy and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a figurehead. The old man thinks that the Sleeper is a made-up figure used to brainwash the population.\\nGraham meets Ostrog, who says that the rebels have won and that the people are demanding that the Sleeper should rule. Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry; and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life ends when Helen tells him that for the lower class the revolution has changed nothing. Graham questions Ostrog who admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited but defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so.\\nOstrog admits that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council. Ostrog has used a black African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself.\\nGraham visits London in disguise to see how the workers live. Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers toil in factories, paid in food for each days work, with no job security. They speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife. Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade. The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by \\\"babble machines\\\" which spread news and \\\"pleasure cities\\\" where unspecified joys are available. \\\"Euthanasy\\\" is considered normal.\\nGraham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London. Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London.\\nOstrog escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London. His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks Ostrog's aeroplane but fails. Graham's aeroplane crashes.\",\n                \"genres\": [],\n                \"copyright\": \"Public domain in the USA.\",\n                \"title\": \"The Sleeper Awakes\",\n                \"averageRating\": null,\n                \"ratingCount\": null,\n                \"similarBooks\": [],\n                \"description\": null,\n                \"locClass\": \"PR: Language and Literatures: English literature\",\n                \"pages\": null,\n                \"language\": \"English\",\n                \"isbn13\": null,\n                \"countries\": [\n                    1\n                ],\n                \"releaseDate\": \"2004-03-31T17:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"author\": 1,\n                \"cover\": \"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png\",\n                \"summary\": \"The Sleeper Awakes (1910) is a dystopian science fiction novel by H.

The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.\\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.\\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.\\nMeanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.\\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.\\nOverwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey. After promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.\",\n        \"genres\": [],\n        \"copyright\": \"Copyrighted.

Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.ï¿½ There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.ï¿½ Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, <b>The Time Machine</b> will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.<br /><br />\",\n        \"locClass\": \"PR: Language and Literatures: English literature\",\n        \"pages\": 118,\n        \"language\": \"English\",\n        \"isbn13\": \"9780451528551\",\n        \"countries\": [\n            1\n        ],\n        \"releaseDate\": \"2004-09-30T17:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"author\": 1,\n        \"cover\": \"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327942880l/2493.jpg\",\n        \"summary\": \"The Time Machine is a science fiction novel by H.

Wells is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \\\"time machine\\\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.\\nThe Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.\",\n        \"contentCleaned\": true,\n        \"classes\": [\n            \"to-read\",\n            \"currently-reading\",\n            \"classics\",\n            \"science-fiction\",\n            \"sci-fi\",\n            \"fiction\",\n            \"classic\",\n            \"favorites\",\n            \"time-travel\",\n            \"fantasy\",\n            \"owned\",\n            \"scifi\",\n            \"books-i-own\",\n            \"kindle\",\n            \"dystopia\",\n            \"sci-fi-fantasy\",\n            \"literature\",\n            \"adventure\",\n            \"dystopian\",\n            \"steampunk\",\n            \"sf\",\n            \"1001-books\",\n            \"novels\",\n            \"ebook\",\n            \"19th-century\",\n            \"ebooks\",\n            \"owned-books\",\n            \"audiobook\",\n            \"1001\",\n            \"british\",\n            \"classic-literature\",\n            \"scifi-fantasy\",\n            \"to-buy\",\n            \"audiobooks\",\n            \"english\",\n            \"library\",\n            \"my-ebooks\",\n            \"fantasy-sci-fi\",\n            \"school\",\n            \"classics-to-read\",\n            \"default\",\n            \"adult\",\n            \"science-fiction-fantasy\",\n            \"h-g-wells\",\n            \"1001-books-to-read-before-you-die\",\n            \"speculative-fiction\",\n            \"e-books\",\n            \"novel\",\n            \"science\",\n            \"classic-fiction\",\n            \"favourites\",\n            \"my-library\",\n            \"british-literature\",\n            \"e-book\",\n            \"my-books\",\n            \"victorian\",\n            \"audio\",\n            \"adult-fiction\",\n            \"book-club\",\n            \"books\",\n            \"read-for-school\",\n            \"classic-lit\",\n            \"sci-fi-and-fantasy\",\n            \"read-in-2015\",\n            \"to-read-classics\",\n            \"i-own\",\n            \"nook\",\n            \"read-in-2014\",\n            \"read-in-2016\",\n            \"english-literature\",\n            \"novella\",\n            \"fantasy-scifi\",\n            \"audio-books\",\n            \"wish-list\",\n            \"1800s\",\n            \"england\",\n            \"kindle-books\",\n            \"own-it\",\n            \"classic-sci-fi\",\n            \"1001-books-you-must-read-before-you\",\n            \"historical\",\n            \"read-in-2013\",\n            \"read-in-english\",\n            \"horror\",\n            \"young-adult\",\n            \"ciencia-ficciï¿½n\",\n            \"read-in-2017\",\n            \"sf-masterworks\",\n            \"british-lit\",\n            \"audible\",\n            \"historical-fiction\",\n            \"owlcrate\",\n            \"uk\",\n            \"audio-book\",\n            \"post-apocalyptic\",\n            \"re-read\",\n            \"future\",\n            \"sf-fantasy\",\n            \"travel\",\n            \"time\"\n        ],\n        \"contentAvailable\": false,\n        \"nAuthors\": 1,\n        \"wikipediaId\": null,\n        \"goodreadsId\": null,\n        \"gutenbergId\": null\n    }\n}"
