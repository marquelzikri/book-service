# Book Service 

I am using [this template](yonathan06/fastify-typescript-boilerplate) to demonstrate the usage of Prisma inside Fastify Now. Clone this project and run this by yourself.

## Set Up

- Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

- Start the server in development mode.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Postman examples
You can use these REST request examples at Postman, just import [this JSON file](https://github.com/marquelzikri/book-service/blob/master/book-service.postman_collection.json) to your Postman.
